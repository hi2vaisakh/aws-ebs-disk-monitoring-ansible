# aws-ebs-disk-monitoring-ansible
AWS Multi-Account Disk Utilization Monitoring with Ansible
This repository contains an Ansible playbook that assumes a standardized role in multiple AWS accounts (organized under AWS Organizations), discovers EC2 instances, gathers disk utilization via AWS Systems Manager (SSM), aggregates the results into a JSON file, and optionally uploads that file to both Amazon S3 and Datadog for further monitoring.

Architecture Overview

AWS Organizations: A Management Account oversees multiple Member Accounts.

Management Account: Hosts the Ansible Control Node.

Cross-Account IAM Roles: Each Member Account has a role allowing the Management Account to assume and query EC2.

Ansible Playbook:

Discovers EC2 instances (tagged with ansible: yes) via cross-account role assumption.

Gathers disk usage metrics via AWS SSM.

Aggregates the results into a JSON file.

Uploads the file to an S3 bucket.

Optionally sends the metrics to Datadog.

Requirements
Ansible 2.10+

AWS Collections:

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws community.aws
AWS Credentials with permission to assume roles in each Member Account.

AWS SSM Agent installed on your EC2 instances.

IAM Roles: Each Member Account has a cross-account role (e.g. CrossAccountEC2ReadRole) trusting the Management Account.

S3 Bucket for uploading the aggregated report.

Datadog (optional) for advanced monitoring and dashboards.

Configuration
Group Variables (group_vars/all.yml):

yaml
Copy
Edit
# List of AWS accounts
aws_accounts:
  - account_id: "20756xxxxx467"
    role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::20756xxxxx467:role/CrossAccountEC2ReadRole"
  # Add more accounts here if needed

# Single region to consider
aws_region: "ap-northeast-1"

# SSM file-transfer bucket name (bucket must exist in the target region)
ssm_bucket: "ansible-ssm-ebs-disk-utilization"

# Datadog (optional)
datadog_api_key: "YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY"
datadog_endpoint: "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/series"
Ansible Configuration (ansible.cfg):

ini
Copy
Edit
[defaults]
transport = aws_ssm
inventory = ./aws_dynamic_inventory.py
remote_tmp = /tmp/.ansible/tmp
host_key_checking = False
Note: If youâ€™re not using a dynamic inventory script, replace inventory with the appropriate file.

Playbook (multi_region_disk_utilization.yml):
See the final code snippet in this repository. It contains tasks to assume roles, gather EC2 disk usage, write to aggregated_disk_usage.json, upload to S3, and optionally send data to Datadog.

Usage
Install Requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws community.aws
Ensure Your AWS Credentials can assume the specified cross-account roles.

Run the Playbook:

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-playbook multi_region_disk_utilization.yml
Check Output:

The aggregated JSON file (aggregated_disk_usage.json) is written locally.

The same file is uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.

If Datadog integration is enabled, the metrics are sent to Datadog.
